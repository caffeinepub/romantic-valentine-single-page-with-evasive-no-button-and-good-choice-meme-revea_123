  "summary": "Diff adds a React Valentine page with a success state showing “Good choice” and referencing the meme image path, plus romantic-themed global CSS. However, it also introduces backend and Internet Identity/auth/react-query plumbing that was explicitly out of scope, and the required static meme asset file itself is not evidenced as added under frontend/public/assets/generated.",
